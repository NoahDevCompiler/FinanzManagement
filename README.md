# Finanz Management-System

This is a finance management system project that I built with a school friend. It consists of two main components: an API built with C# ASP.NET and a frontend built with Vue.js.

Download or clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/NoahDevCompiler/FinanzManagement.git

Open the project in Visual Studio by navigating to the FM_API folder.

Install any necessary dependencies.

Set up the database:

  Execute the provided SQL file in MySQL to set up the database schema.

  Update the database connection string in the **_config.txt_** file with your MySQL credentials.

Run the API project in Visual Studio.

### Frontend (FM folder)
